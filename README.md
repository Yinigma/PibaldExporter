# Pibald Exporter

This is a Blender plugin that supports the work-in-progress renderer "Pibald." It exports mesh, color, armature, and animation data in a custom binary format for use with Pibald.

Currently this repository has no purpose other than showing people I can make Blender plugins and I'm familiar with reading/writing data as bytes. Eventually I intend to have people install this to easily create custom content for games made using the finished Pibald renderer.
